# PX2020
This repository is used to enable the development of a new PX file format for statistics dissemination. 

# Introduction
PX is a well established format for the presentation and representation of statistical data. Its advantages include compactness and ease of reading, both for machines
and humans. However, a number of shortcomings have been identified, mainly around the area of ambiguous dimensions and the intermingling of presentation data with representation 
data.
This project attempts to deal with these problems by developing a new specification for PX.
