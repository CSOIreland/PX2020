# PXS (PX Standard)
The **PXS** or **PX Standard** is a **DRAFT** for standardising the exchange and dissemination of statistical data and meta-data over a `text/plain` file type.

# Introduction
The current [PX Format](https://github.com/CSOIreland/PXS-Standard/files/5095402/px-file_format_specification_2013.pdf) is a well established format for the presentation and representation of statistical data. Its advantages include compactness and ease of reading, both for machines and humans. However, a number of shortcomings have been identified, mainly around the area of ambiguous dimensions, the presentation of data and the syntaxt/schema.

This project attempts to deal with these problems by upgrading the **PX Format** to the new **PXS Standard**.

## Format Vs Standard

A clear and simple definition of **Format** is _"a way to encode information  for storage in a computer file"_.

Instead, a **Standard** is about _"enabling the interoperability between different programs created by different developers"_.
