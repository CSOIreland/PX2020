# PXS (PX Standard)
The **PXS** or **PX Standard** is a **DRAFT** for standardising the exchange and dissemination of statistical data and meta-data over a `plain/text` file.

# Introduction
The current PX Format is a well established format for the presentation and representation of statistical data. Its advantages include compactness and ease of reading, both for machines and humans. However, a number of shortcomings have been identified, mainly around the area of ambiguous dimensions, the presentation of data and the syntaxt/schema.

This project attempts to deal with these problems by upgrading the PX Format to the new PXS Standard.
