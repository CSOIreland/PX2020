# PXS Standard
This repository is used to enable the development of the new Standard for exchanging and disseminating statistical data and meta-data. 

# Introduction
The PX Format is well established for the presentation and representation of statistical data. Its advantages include compactness and ease of reading, both for machines
and humans. However, a number of shortcomings have been identified, mainly around the area of ambiguous dimensions and the intermingling of presentation data with representation 
data.
This project attempts to deal with these problems by upgrading the PX Format (PX) to the new PX Standard (PXS).
